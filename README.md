# -ext-file-translator
In this project I use the open source library for python "deep_translator".
in particular I use the translator "GoogleTranslator".

to use the program you need to enter a global or relative path to the file and the desired language for translation.

after which the program will open the file, split the text for translation using GoogleTranslator
and write the translation to the file "{file_name}_translate.txt"
